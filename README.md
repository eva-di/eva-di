# Hi, my name is Eva.

I'm currently taking a **QA automation** course and seriously focused on building a career in testing. 
I’m learning how to write automated tests using **Python**, **Java**, and **Selenium**, and gaining a solid understanding of software development and quality assurance.

At the same time, I’m exploring frontend development — learning **HTML**,**CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 
I enjoy working on small projects to apply what I’ve learned and improve my practical skills.

I'm committed to growing step by step and becoming a strong QA specialist with a good understanding of the development process.
